# Career+

## Description

**Career+** is a digital platform prototype designed to support students in finding, applying for, and managing international Erasmus+ internships. It serves as a unified space connecting students, employers (companies and academic institutions), and universities — simplifying administrative processes, sharing knowledge, and building a European career network centered around the University of Zagreb.

This is a **frontend-only mockup** built to demonstrate the concept and user interface of the platform.
